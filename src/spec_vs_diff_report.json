  "summary": "The implementation provides a comprehensive AdAware Explainable AI Framework with Motoko backend, React/TypeScript frontend, and all required pages. Most requirements are satisfied, including backend data structures, prediction logic, analytics methods, all frontend pages (Home, Predict, Results, Model Insights, Admin Dashboard, About), navigation, custom canvas-based charts, and PDF generation. However, the diff is truncated and several files are omitted, making full verification impossible. Notable gaps include missing Home page implementation, incomplete About page content, and placeholder PDF generation using TXT format instead of actual PDF.",
